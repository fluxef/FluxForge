## Reporting a Vulnerability / Security Issue

If you think that you have found a security issue in FluxForge, don't use the bug tracker and don't publish
it publicly. 

Instead, all security issues must be sent to security@ins.de. Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the INS core team private mailing-list.
All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
